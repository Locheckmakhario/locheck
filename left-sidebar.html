											<h3>Mission</h3>
											<p>Medical Missions will aim at training and transforming the unreached communities in sub-Saharan East African nations holistically through provision of subsidised medical services and mobile surgeries, impacting them with the true gospel of Jesus Christ starting with the ones in greatest need. We would see this as a partnership with the communities and their leaders networking together with government services, the churches, medics from East Africa and medics doing short term medical missions with us from developed countries. Underpinning everything would be Jesus’ prayer in Matthew 6:9,10.</p>

											<h2>Vision</h2>
											<p>The vision of MM is “To bring hope and healing to the unreached people groups among the people of Greater Kapoeta, and other unreached communities of East Africa, transforming their lives holistically with Christ at the centre”.</p>

											<h3>Our Background</h3>
											<p>Struggling to provide medical services to most of her citizens in various states, the administration on the ground has divided South Sudan into states which are further divided into counties with major towns and rural areas (areas far from town or administrative areas). One of these places is Kapoeta.​</p>

											<p>Greater Kapoeta (Kapoeta east, north and south) as one of the major counties of Eastern Equatoria in South Sudan with a large population is one of the areas with no properly functioning hospitals. There is a limited supply of dispensaries with a few clinicians and nurses from the neighbouring countries like Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia. Generally, they are not able to handle some complicated cases. As a personal example, my mom, has been struggling with chest problems with no proper diagnosis or treatment for ten years now. This is true for many Toposa families especially if they live out of town. However, we very much appreciate the efforts and sacrifices that neighbouring medical staff make for us. Rural areas of Greater Kapoeta have limited medical facilities and no doctors that can go to such areas to deliver medical services. People in these areas are surviving by God’s grace.</p>

											<p>When We looked at this situation, we realized that there was a great need in Toposa land which is on God’s heart. Yet now, some people like us who have had opportunities by God’s grace to study medicine, can make some changes among our people especially on issues of health. With a few of my Christian friends, it is my prayer to start a group/team of medics who can reach out to our people in remote areas of Kapoeta South, Kapoeta North (many living more than 100km away from town) and Kapoeta East/Kauto/Jie (more than 200km away) where health services are totally inaccessible. The life expectancy and quality of living is heart breaking.</p>

											<p>As Medical Missions healthcare providers, our God given vision is to bring hope and healing to the unreached people groups of Greater Kapoeta, transforming their lives holistically with Christ at the centre, through provision of medical services, discipleship based evangelism, basic trainings and strengthening healthcare systems in Toposa land and other unreached people groups in the region.</p>
